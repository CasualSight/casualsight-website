    <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold mb-12">Our Story</h2>
    <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-800 space-y-6">
        Building electronic music instruments is tough. Really tough.<br><br>
        We know how it feels to pour your heart into a sound that’s meant to move people, only to spend weeks or months chasing down manufacturers who just don’t get it — or who say “sorry, your quantity is too small.”<br><br>
        We’ve been there.<br><br>
        For years we built consumer electronics — big runs, tight tolerances, everything perfect. But when we finally created our own boutique synthesizers, the ones we dreamed would touch souls, we hit that painful wall: “Too small. Not worth our time.” It hurt. Because those instruments weren’t just products to us — they were pieces of our passion, our late nights, our deepest sonic feelings.<br><br>
        So we said: enough.<br><br>
        We gathered a small team of people who love sound as much as we do, we built our own factory from the ground up, and we started making our synths exactly the way we wanted — with care, precision, and real understanding of what an instrument needs to feel alive in your hands.<br><br>
        Now we’re here for you.<br><br>
        We’ve walked the same path you’re on. We know how precious every knob, every oscillator, every little sonic touch or blast is to you. We get it — because we feel it too.<br><br>
        <span class="text-primary"><b>You create the soul.</b></span><br>
        <b>We craft the body that lets your music breathe, sing, and touch others.</b><br><br>
        Let’s make something beautiful together.<br><br>
    </p>
